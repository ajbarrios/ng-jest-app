# Ng Jest App

This project is an example of how to add Jest to Angular with some UI components and unit tests with snapshots.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

- Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jest.io).
- Run `npm run test:watch` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jest.io) with test reloading.
